-------------------
The object of this project is to create
a Arduino compatible robot controller using a minimum 
of parts.

Bootloader
-------------------
The Simduino RBC uses the USBaspLoader
http://www.obdev.at/products/vusb/usbasploader.html
which uses a software only USB driver to connect to the 
computer without a FTDI chip.
note: it does not create a COM port,
instead it enumerates as a HID device
